        <h2>Support Worker's Role Explained</h2>
        <p class="care-giver-definition">
          A support worker is individual who assists another person with daily activities and personal hygiene. Although family members and friends can provide this type of care for a loved one, "our support workers" are trained to deliver specialized home care and support services that benefit people living with disabilities. Professional support workers can assist for a short time (respite care) or long-term, including 24/7 care. They can also provide one-to-one services and assisted living facilities for people living with disabilities.

              At the heart of this position is the relationship between the support worker and the Client. You should have a big heart, kind soul and organizational skills. Your duties often involve ensuring you understand the Client’s care needs and supporting them to enhance their quality of life. Awesome Disability offices commonly look for these qualities in Support Worker:
